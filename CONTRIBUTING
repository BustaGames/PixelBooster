Pixel::Booster - Guideline for contributing with this project
(WORK IN PROGRESS!)

Compiling the application

To compile the application you need Qt5 (Version 5.5.1 is suggested) installed on your machine. Then you need to:
Execute lupdate and lrelease to generate the translation files
And then compile everything else as a normal Qt project (QMake and then compile, or do it through QtCreator)

Code Style

For the Code Style, we use the C++ Guidelines from Google, which can be found on the following link: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html
We try to stick to the rules on it whenever it is possible. If you are doing a code review on an existing code, try to improve it to ensure it is following the rules.

Features

When implementing a new feature that is not completely specified, try to keep the default usability found in other similar tools. If the new feature is exclusive or something new, and it is not completely specified, try to ask any of the authors of the application what is the way to go.
